FILES: 

lab4c_tcp.c
*This program is intended to perform an unencrypted communication with
the specified ucla server for TCP. 
*In addition to lab4b several options have been added including the host, id,
and port number.
*A TCP connection is made at the appropriate port and address and is meant to
log the temperature data colelcted from beaglebone sensor and terminating with
newline chars.
* Several error checks are made to determine that the above mandatory options are
set, the connection is made, the buffer is holding data and other relevant checks
to correctly process and log the temperatures.
*C program that builds and executes on beaglebone, uses lmraa flag

lab4c_tls.c
*This program is similar to the above one, but this operates on a TLS connection
*This handles an encrypted communication with the server using the appropriate
address and port to determine the logging of temperature data.
*This C program builds and executes on the beaglebone also: uses lmraa flag
*This program incoporates the lcrypto flag to encrypt

MakeFile
*Includes 3 targets to make the c programs above into executables
**default - builds both executable programs
**clean- deletes the programs and returns the directory to a pre-made snapshot
state (before any file creations as the result of any of these makefile commands).
**dist - creates a distributable tarball that allows us to combine with the
bash sanity script file to check a mock successful version of our program. We
passed the check

README
*This file which gives a brief overview of included files and details provided
by them

passed.PNG
*A png showing a passed sanity script if this helps/contributes to grading at all

Sources/Notes:
*Note that some sources are included inline in the programs, or were referenced
from previous submission in lab4b
**
Open winscp for linux server and beaglebone
Open putty for linux and beaglebone
Write codes on linux
Use winscp to copy the files from linux server to beaglebone
Start testing on beaglebone
*had to download the ssl library using
*sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
