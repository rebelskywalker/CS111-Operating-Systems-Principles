## Files

### Makefile
- **default**: Builds the `lab3b` executable from the `lab3b.py` source file. This command creates a symbolic link named `lab3b` to `lab3b.py` and sets it as executable.
- **clean**: Removes the `lab3b` executable and any existing tarball, returning the directory to its state before any make commands were executed.
- **dist**: Creates a tarball named `lab3b-999999999.tar.gz` containing `lab3b.py`, `README`, and `Makefile`.

### lab3b.py
A Python 3 script that performs a consistency analysis on a file system summary file. It checks for inconsistencies in:
- **Invalid Blocks**: Blocks that are not valid according to the file system.
- **Reserved Blocks**: Blocks that should not be used.
- **Allocated Blocks**: Blocks that are allocated but not on the free list.
- **Unreferenced Blocks**: Blocks that are not referenced anywhere but are not on the free list.
- **Duplicate Blocks**: Blocks that are referenced by multiple inodes.
- **Inodes**: Checks if inodes are properly allocated and if they are present in the free list.
- **Directories**: Ensures directories are consistent with inode allocations and directory entries.

### README
This file provides information on the files included in the tarball and their purposes.
